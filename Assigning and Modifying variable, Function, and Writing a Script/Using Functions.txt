Using Functions
One of the main benefits of using R is that you can access a huge variety of functions, which are sets of commands that perform a particular action. Some functions, for example, can find the maximum value in a vector, while some can carry out complex statistical analyses. 

Function:
Functions are one of the main building blocks of R, and understanding how to use functions will help you unlock a whole host of possibilities for writing code and analyzing data.

#Using Function:

KODK <- c(21.00, 24.00, 23.10, 24.75, 26.50, 25.50)

#Find a maximum value
max(KODK)
maxKODK <- max(KODK)

#Find a minimum value
min(KODK)
minKODK <- min(KODK)

#Find a mean value:
ave <- mean(KODK)
ave


#Find the length of you data
n <- length(KODK)
n


Writing a Script
You get immediate results when you run commands in the R console. If you wanted to reuse those same commands later, however, you would need to type them into the console again, which can be tedious at best and inaccurate at worst. 


#Writing a Script

#Add a text to your script
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
y <- sample(x, size = 3)
maxy <- max(y)
miny <- min(y)
diff <- maxy - miny
diff
