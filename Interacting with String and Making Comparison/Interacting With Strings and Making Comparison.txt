Interacting With Strings


What if you want to organize or analyze text data from a survey? Not only can you use R with numerical data, but you can also use it to interact with text. In R, text data are referred to as strings and categorized as a separate data type. In this video, Dr. Entner explains the basics of using strings in R, including how R interprets spaces and capitalization.

#Interacting with String

"yes"

#Create a longer string:

"Not likely"

#Create a vector of strings:

c("Yes","Yes","No")

#Notice that even though you didn't type quotation marks around the 10,
#it comes back with quotation marks.
#This is because vectors in R cannot have both strings and numbers,
#so R has turned 10 into a string. 
c("Yes", "No",10)


#Attemp to add a string with a number:

"10" + 10


Making Comparisons
You can get a lot of information from your data by asking questions in the right way, and one method for doing that is by comparing data values. For example, you might want to know if two people answered questions the same way on a survey. R can compare two data points in a variety of ways then tell you whether that comparison is true or false.


#Making Comparison:

#Check if one number is equal to another number:
#Enter 1 == 1 into the console.
#R lets you know that the numbers on either side of == are the same by returning the text TRUE.
1 == 1

#Check if one number is not equal t another number:

#Enter 1 != 1 into the console.
#R lets you know that the numbers on either side of != are the same by returning the text FALSE.

1 != 1

#Enter 1 != 2 into the console.
#R lets you know that the numbers on either side of != are not the same by returning the text TRUE. 

1 != 2


#Check if one number is greater than another number:

#Enter 1 > 1 into the console.
#R lets you know that the number on the left side of the > symbol is not greater than the number on the right side by returning the text FALSE.

1 > 1

#Check if one number is greater than or equal to another number.

#Enter 1 >= 1 into the console.
#R lets you know that the number on the left side of the >= symbol is greater than or equal to the number on the right side by returning the text TRUE. 

1 >= 1


#Check if a character is greater than or equal to another character.

#Enter "a" > "b" into the console.
#Here, R evaluates the comparison based on where the character is in the alphabet. Since "a" comes before "b", R returns FALSE.

"a" < "b"

#Check whether components in a numeric vector are less than those in a corresponding vector.

#Type the following into the console: c(1,2,3) < c(2,1,-3).
#Here, R evaluates each component of the vector on the right relative to the corresponding component of the vector on the left.
#R returns a sequence of TRUE or FALSE that corresponds to each component. 


c(1,2,3) < c(2,1,-3)


#Check whether components in a string vector are equal to those in a corresponding vector.

#Type the following into the console: c("yes", "yes") == c("yes", "no"). 
#As in the previous example, R evaluates each component of the vector on the right relative to the corresponding component of the vector on the left.
#R returns a sequence of TRUE or FALSE that corresponds to each component.

c("yes","Yes") == c("yes", "no")
